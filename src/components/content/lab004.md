When the button is clicked, the function below is fired:

```js
const handleScroll = () => {
  window.scroll({
    top: 500,
    behavior: 'auto',
  })
}
```

We access the global 'window' object, drill down into its 'scroll' function, then provide it with an options object. `top: 500` makes the 500th pixel on the y-axis the new top of the web view. Remember that the the origin of the webpage is at the top left corner of the page, so moving down the y-axis results in an increasing positive value. The `behavior: smooth` makes the movement animate smoothly vs. jumping suddenly.

## Horizontal Scrolling

Below is a containing div filled with content that overflows its width, resulting in a horizontal scrollbar. Try to scroll left and right with your mouse wheel within the containing div. Pretty cool huh? Outside of the containg div, the mouse wheel acts as normal, scrolling vertically.
