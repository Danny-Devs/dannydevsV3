Were you surprised at all when you saw the above demonstration? If so, it might reflect the current fact we still find the complex animation of real-life physics on the web to be unique, eye-catching, or communicative in a certain special way.

The simulation of physics and the visualization of math (as well as data in general) are strengths of the web that can be leveraged using Javascript libraries such as Matter.js.

According to its [website](https://brm.io/matter-js/), Matter.js is a 2D physics engine for the web. It builds on top of the web's Canvas API to provide 2D physics to the browser environment. It can be used in games, simulations, and other rich experiences.

The [Getting started](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/wiki/Getting-started) page contains installation instructions as well as a handy minimal example. I used that example and modified it to create the physics animation above.

I needed additional resources to progress. This [one](https://speakerdeck.com/lonekorean/exploring-2d-physics-in-javascript?slide=14), interestingly, was a slide deck, but I found it very helpful to click through. The demo below was created from a tutorial contained within it.
