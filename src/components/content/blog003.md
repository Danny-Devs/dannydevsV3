# Branding DannyDevs: Art Asset Production and Management

Everyone knows that branding has value. Thus, I have decided to take branding seriously for my DannyDevs company.

In this post, I'm going to focus on the artistic aspect of branding DannyDevs.

DannyDevs is a venture that I've been thinking about for quite some time. It's named after me, the author, but I only thought of the name recently--within the last couple of years or so. The purpose of it? To launch my new professional career in web development.

In today's day and age, everyone is a brand, including front end web developers. Take a look at YouTube, where channels created by web devs require 2D and motion graphics for branding for their channel and videos. DannyDevs is my brand.

My current media outlets include:

#### dannydevs.com
This is where the magic happens. This is where the developer who wants a public presence shows that they are the real thing.

#### YouTube

My dad was an educator, and I followed him into the education business. YouTube is where I plan to deliver high quality, polished, short-form tutorials.

#### Twitter

Every dev knows about tech Twitter.

#### Github

This is where other developers will know if you are the real thing.

#### Twitch

I find that streaming web dev work sessions is fun and actually improves my productivity. Branding is less important here because growth in this arena is not necessary according to current strategy.
## Art Assets created/acquired

> Note: "dd" means DannyDevs


| Art Assets  | dannydevs.com | YouTube | Twitter | Github | Twitch
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| dd avatar  | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div>
| dd favicon  | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> |  |  |  |
| dd logotype  | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> |   | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div>
| subscribe watermark  |  |  <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> |  |  |
| banner  |  |  |  |  |  <div i-carbon-checkmark></div>

Additional assets in the asset library:

- space breaker: pixel art. ready to be animated.
- sprite skeleton with sword and shield

## Art Assets to acquire

| Art Assets  | dannydevs.com | YouTube | Twitter | Github | Twitch
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| photos | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | | | |
| banners | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | | | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div>
| videos | | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | <div i-carbon-checkmark></div> | |

For dannydevs.com, I need some photos to liven up the "About" page and provide some real life imagery to the website as a whole. Of course YouTube requires videos, but an interesting idea would be to cross-post onto Twitch (and Instagram, which I just discovered has a web dev community--I'll be exploring it in the coming weeks and assessing if it belongs in the DD strategy).

## Conclusion

The result of this post was a clear understanding of what art assets remain to be produced for the DannyDevs brand. The videos art assets will require the implementation of a new workflow, from writing a script, to recording and editing, to adding graphics, and finally to publishing. I'm going to go work on the first video for the DannyDevs YouTube channel now! Till next time, Danny Devs out!
