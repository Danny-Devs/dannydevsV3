title: vueUse's useEyeDropper and the slick EyeDropper web API
description: Vue JS education
---

The vueUse useEyeDropper utility provides additional features around the amazing (but still experimental) [EyeDropper](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper_API) web API. As of [now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper_API#browser_compatibility) the API is compatible with Chrome, Edge, and Opera, but no other browsers. Hopefully that will change soon.

Here is [demo code](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse/blob/main/packages/core/useEyeDropper/demo.vue) that I analyzed to make this lab's introductory demo:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useEyeDropper } from '@vueuse/core'
const { isSupported, open, sRGBHex } = useEyeDropper()
</script>

<template>
  <template v-if="isSupported">
    <div>isSupported: {{ isSupported }}</div>
    <div>sRGBHex: <span :style="{ color: sRGBHex }">{{ sRGBHex }}</span></div>
    <button
      :disabled="!isSupported"
      @click="() => open()"
    >
      Open Eye Dropper
    </button>
  </template>
  <div v-else>
    <span>Not Supported by Your Browser</span>
  </div>
</template>
```

The `useEyeDropper` function spits out:

- a Boolean, isSupported, which checks if your browser supports the experimental EyeDropper API. We use it to conditionally render the page: either it works, or tells the user the API is not supported.

- an `open` function, which is an `async` function that `await`s the actual window.EyeDropper.open function, which magnifies the pixels under the user's mouse pointer and returns the selected pixel's color, which is then handed off to Vue.

- sRGBHex is a string that describes colors using the sRGB hex triplet format. It stores the last color that the user selected.

The [useEyeDropper function](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse/blob/main/packages/core/useEyeDropper/index.ts) is given below. It is a terse piece of code! `useSupported` is imported to bring more refined checking whether the API is supported or now; it works for both regular .js composables and also for .vue files, which have a lifecycle and require that the check be initiated after the component is mounted into the DOM.

```javascript
import { ref } from 'vue-demi'
import { useSupported } from '../useSupported'

export function useEyeDropper(options = {}) {
  const { initialValue = '' } = options
  const isSupported = useSupported(() => typeof window !== 'undefined' && 'EyeDropper' in window)
  const sRGBHex = ref(initialValue)

  async function open(openOptions?: EyeDropperOpenOptions) {
    if (!isSupported.value)
      return
    const eyeDropper: EyeDropper = new (window as any).EyeDropper()
    const result = await eyeDropper.open(openOptions)
    sRGBHex.value = result.sRGBHex
    return result
  }

  return { isSupported, sRGBHex, open }
}
```

Another interesting thing to note is that Anthony has imported `ref` from [vue-demi](https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi), which is an ingenious package that allows for authors to easily write npm libraries for Vue that are universal (working in both Vue 2 and Vue 3).

## Next Steps

I can think of a few project ideas involving useEyeDropper, such as a palette creator (save colors while you surf the web! Organize them into collections! Drag them around to reorganize them.).

I can also see it being super useful as a web design tool, which means it might be ideal to leverage it in a Chrome extension. I'm going to research this right now to see if it's feasible as a shorter-term project. I checked for eyedroppers in the Chrome store a while back and found the offerings to be disappointing, so let's check again to see if there's a market for it! DannyDevs out!
