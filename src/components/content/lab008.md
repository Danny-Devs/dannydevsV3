Ah yes, the famous Matrix screen saver effect. The full screen effect is done using CSS's absolute positioning and vueUse's [useWindowSize](https://vueuse.org/core/usewindowsize/) utility, which provides the reactive width and height of the browser window which we can send in to the `<canvas>` element to tell it to cover the entire window.

I had a bear of a time troubleshooting how to disable vertical scrolling while in the screen saver effect, but in the end it was vanilla JS that worked well for me: `document.body.style = 'overflow-y: hidden'` to hide the vertical scrollbar and `document.body.style = 'overflow-y: auto'` to return the vertical scrollbar back to normal.

> UX edge case: If users hit the back button while in "screen saver mode", they will find that the vertical scroll bars have disappeared and they are unable to navigate vertically. Solution: Use an `onUnmounted` function along with `document.body.style = 'overflow-y: auto'` to ensure vertical scroll bar behavior remains normal for the rest of the website. I also cleared my `setInterval` function and removed the window resize event listener in `onUnmounted` to prevent memory leaks.

You can check out the Matrix digital rain effect [code](https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/matrix-raining-code-effect-using-javascript-4hep), which is both clever and concise. There are other implementations out there as well.
