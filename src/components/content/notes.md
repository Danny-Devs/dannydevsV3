# Notes

## How to change your favicon

Go to the index.html file in the project root directory.

In the head section, you could add or edit the code to read something like:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/dd-favicon-avatar.png" type="image/png" />
```

[Favicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) range from 16x16 to 64x64 pixels, so create your image accordingly. They don't have to be .ico files, they can also be .png, .gif, or .svg.
